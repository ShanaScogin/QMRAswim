An R Package which models the range of probability of illnesses from swimming in a sewage impacted water body from research by Katherine Crank and Kyle Bibby. The development of this package has currently been put on hold. If you are interested in contributing, please submit an issue to begin a conversation. 

# Introduction
`QMRAswim` is an R package which models the range of probability of illnesses from swimming in a sewage-impacted water body. The inputs include the measured concentration of the indicator organism and the desired reference values, and the output is the probability of illness from pathogens. 

# Installing The Package
Currently the package can be downloaded with the devtools package in R from GitHub. To do this, install devtools by calling:

```
install.packages("devtools")
```

Now we can install from GitHub with the following line:

```
devtools::install_github("ShanaScogin/QMRAswim")
```

Once you have installed the package, you can access it by calling:

```
library(QMRAswim)
```
After the package is loaded, check out the `?QMRAswim` to see a help file.
