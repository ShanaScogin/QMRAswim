An R Package which models the range of probability of illnesses from swimming in a sewage impacted water body from research by Katherine Crank and Kyle Bibby. The development of this package has currently been put on hold. If you are interested in contributing or taking over this project, please submit an issue to begin a conversation. 

# Introduction
`QMRAswim` is an R package which models the range of probability of illnesses from swimming in a sewage-impacted water body. The inputs include the measured concentration of the indicator organism and the desired reference values, and the output is the probability of illness from pathogens.
