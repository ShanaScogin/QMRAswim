#' @section QMRAswim functions: These functions model the range of probability of illnesses 
#' from swimming in a sewage-impacted water body. The inputs include the measured concentration 
#' of the indicator organism and the desired reference values, and the output is the 
#' probability of illness from pathogens. The package can be used along with a Shiny 
#' tool available online.
